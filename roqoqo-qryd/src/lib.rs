//! # roqoqo-qryd
//!
//! The `roqoqo-qryd` rust crate implements [qoqo](https://github.com/HQSquantumsimulations/qoqo) support for quantum computers and quantum computer emulators of the [QRydDemo](https://thequantumlaend.de/qryddemo/) project.
//!
//! The QRydDemo project builds on Quantum computers using Rydberg atoms.
//! qoqo is quantum computing toolkit by [HQS Quantum Simulations](https://quantumsimulations.de).
//!
//! The roqoqo-qryd package contains the following functionality:
//!
//! ### Interface to the current QRydDemo WebAPI
//!
//! At the moment QRydDemo WebAPI allows access to Quantum Hardware Emulators of different device topology. roqoqo-qryd supports interfacing with the corresponding [REST-API](https://api.qryddemo.itp3.uni-stuttgart.de/docs) with low level calls as well as a high-level backend to qoqo quantum programs. For this it provides the backend `APIBackend` to evaluate roqoqo quantum programs and the `api_devices` module to represent devices available on the emulators.
//!
//! ### QRydDemo specific hardware operations (prototype)
//!
//! Rydberg atom based quantum devices support, in principle, operations not commonly found in other quantum hardware. Changes in device topology are one of these operations. roqoqo-qryd adds support for changes in device topology to roqoqo via the operations in its `pragma_operations` module.
//! Note that this is a preview prototype and does not represent a finalized set of operations on the QRydDemo hardware.
//!
//! ### Local simulator supporting specific hardware operations
//!
//! roqoqo-qryd includes a local [QuEST](https://github.com/QuEST-Kit/QuEST) based simulator for quantum devices supporting the Rydberg specific quantum operations. The simulator is intended to let users test the capabilities of quantum hardware with the additional operations.
//! roqoqo-qryd provides the simulator via the `SimulatorBackend` backend the implements the roqoqo `Backend` trait.The backend uses the device prototypes in roqoqo-qryd's `qryd_devices` module.
//! Note that the devices for the simulator do not represent a finalised design for QRydDemo.

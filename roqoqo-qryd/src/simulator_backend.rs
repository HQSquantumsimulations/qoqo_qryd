/// QRyd simulator backend
///
/// A QRyd simulator simulates the action of each operation in a circuit on a quantum register.
/// The underlying simulator uses the QuEST library.
/// Although the underlying simulator supports arbitrary unitary gates, the QRyd simulator only
/// allows operations that are available on a device model of a QRyd device (stored in a [crate::QRydDevice]).
/// This limitation is introduced by design to check the compatability of circuits with a model of the QRyd hardware.
/// For unrestricted simulations use the backend simulator of the roqoqo-quest crate.
///
///
/// The simulator backend implements the [roqoqo::backends::EvaluatingBackend] trait
/// and is compatible with  running single circuits, running and evaluating measurements
/// and running QuantumPrograms on simulated QRyd devices.

# Examples

A small collection of example python programs for the QRydHQS software collection.

* `switch_layout_example.py` shows how to construct a QRyd device and using the PragmaChangeQrydLayout operation to switch between layouts in a quantum Circuit.
* `shift_qubits_example.py` shows how to construct a QRyd device and using the PragmaShiftQrydQubit operation to shift qubits between tweezer positions in a quantum Circuit.
* `multi_qubit_example.py` shows how to use multi-qubit-operations.

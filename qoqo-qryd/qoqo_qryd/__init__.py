""" Components for the qoqo/roqoqo quantum toolkit by `HQS Quantum Simulations <https://quantumsimulations.de>`_ that support QRyd quantum computers.

The qoqo-qryd/roqoqo-qryd packages provide three components:

* devices: python/rust representation of QRyd devices
* operations: roqoqo Pragma operations specific to QRyd devices that can change the topology of QRyd devices
* simulator (optional): A QuEST based simulator for QRyd devices that checks the availability of the quantum operations on a chosen device during simulation

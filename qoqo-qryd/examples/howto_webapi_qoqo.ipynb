    "Accessing [QRydDemo](https://thequantumlaend.de/qryddemo/)'s emulator with [Qoqo](https://github.com/HQSquantumsimulations/qoqo) is supported by the software package [qoqo-qryd](https://github.com/HQSquantumsimulations/qoqo_qryd) developed by [HQS Quantum Simulations](https://quantumsimulations.de/). The software is designed to enable the excution of quantum algorithms implemented in Qoqo on the hardware of the QRydDemo consortium. Qoqo is a circuit based quantum computing toolkit. Like many other quantum computing toolkits, it can be used to construct quantum circuits sequences of quantum operations that are to be executed on a quantum computer or on an emulator.\n",

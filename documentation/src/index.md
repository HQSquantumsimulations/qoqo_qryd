Welcome to the qoqo-qryd/roqoqo-qryd user documentation!

This software is designed to support the [QRydDemo](<https://thequantumlaend.de/qryddemo/>) project on quantum computing with Rydberg atoms. It provides components to support QRydDemo quantum computers based on the [qoqo](<https://github.com/HQSquantumsimulations/qoqo>) quantum toolkit by [HQS Quantum Simulations](<https://quantumsimulations.de>) used to represent quantum circuits.

To learn more about the general approach to create quantum programs and executing them in qoqo see [Introduction](src/introduction.md) and [Execution](src/execution.md).

This software is split into two packages:

* roqoqo-qryd: Implementing the core functionality and a Rust interface.
* qoqo-qryd: The Python interface.


The packages are based on the open source [qoqo](<https://github.com/HQSquantumsimulations/qoqo>) quantum computing toolkit.
